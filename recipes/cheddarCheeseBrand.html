			Even those of us who love to cook appreciate a well-made frozen meal that we can pop in the oven after a long day. A new
			line of frozen meals are coming to the grocery store’s freezer aisle, and we’re excited because of the brand behind them. If
			you’re familiar with the Tillamook dairy brand, you’ll know the Oregon-based co-op prides itself on quality products. Its
			ice cream is so good that even professional chefs keep the brand’s ice cream sandwiches in their freezers. In a survey of
			the favorite junk food in each state, Tillamook ice cream beat out all other snacks in Oregon.
